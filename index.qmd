**Data Ethics Across the Disciplines** is a discussion series hosted by the [University of Pittsburgh Library System](https://library.pitt.edu/) during Spring 2024.

## Upcoming Discussions

### Global Perspectives on Ethical Data Management

**A cross-disciplinary workshop on international data projects and cultural approaches to data harm.**

📅 Friday, February 23, 2024    🕛 12--1:30pm

This interactive discussion will explore the benefits and challenges inherent to multi-institutional and international projects that represent diverse disciplinary and cultural data practices. Speaking from varied roles on such projects or programs, presenters will address what it means to take a global cultural approach to data ethics, given the nature of working with data produced by different communities and navigating the complex landscape of international policies and cultural expectations.

A facilitated discussion will follow speaker introductions, aimed at sharing best practices and generating strategies for building global cultural competencies, identifying resources available to support global digital research at Pitt, and creating connections across disciplinary boundaries.

What might it look like for researchers to take an ethical perspective on global data harm when developing international collaborations? What is involved when translating policies to practice and coordinating complex research projects? How might we address implicit power relations, funding inequities, and the continued impact of colonialism on the data produced by our research and other activities? Join us for this conversation to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in global approaches to data ethics.

**Speakers**:

-   **Ruth Mostern**, Professor of History and Director of the World History Center
-   **Stephen Wludarski**, Program Manager for the National Consortium for Teaching about Asia (NCTA) Pittsburgh, Asian Studies Program
-   **Victoria Sterling**, Former Grant Manager for the Geography of Philosophy Project

### Social Media Data Ethics

**Grounding our Values and Localizing ~~Best~~ Better Practices.**

📅 Monday, February 26, 2024    🕛 12--1:30pm

This event aims to bring together members of the Pitt community for an interactive conversation regarding ethics and social media data. Two presenters - Lara Putnam and Elise Silva - will summarize the range of best practice guides that have already been developed on this topic and share a curated, annotated set of these external resources as a starting point with the hope of opening conversation. They hope specifically to localize this discussion around what tools, resources, and/or potential curricular vehicles Pitt teachers, mentors, and scholars feel they need in this rapidly changing arena. Our third presenter - Frances Corry - will then explore how values/ethics are expressed and mobilized by social media platform employees as they handle user data in the platform sunsetting process, providing another framework for thinking through the kinds of data that are generated and stored in social media platforms.

How are social media data used or generated in your disciplinary practices? What ethical concerns might we face across disciplinary boundaries when working with social media data? Join us for this conversation to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in ethical approaches to social media data.

**Speakers:**

-   **Lara Putnam**, UCIS Professor (History), Director of the Global Studies Center, and Co-lead for the Civic Resilience Initiative of the Pitt Disinformation Lab
-   **Elise Silva**, Postdoctoral Associate with Pitt Cyber\'s Disinformation Lab and the Western PA Writing Project

### Pedagogy, Data Governance, and Predictive Analytics

**A conversation on institutional data practices at Pitt.**

📅 Friday, March 1, 2024    🕛 12--1:30pm

This panel assembles perspectives from multiple units across Pitt to explore predictive analytics, institutional data practices, data governance, and their pedagogical and ethical implications within a rapidly evolving technology landscape.

Amanda Brodish will discuss the use of predictive analytics as part of the Pathways Student Success and Advising platform, providing an overview of the process used to engage faculty, students, and administrators in the use of predictive analytics; the development of a process allowing students to opt out; and the specific data points that are (and are not) included in the predictive analytics models. Michael Madison will speak to ongoing work at Pitt around data governance models and policies for institutional data. Gordon Mitchell will explore the question, how can an understanding of predictive analytics enhance data literacy for Pitt students preparing to work in our networked society?

Join us for an engaging discussion to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in data ethics.

**Speakers:**

### Community-centered Ethics for Digital Cultural Heritage Materials

**A dialogue on the tensions between consent, preservation, and access.**

📅 Monday, March 4, 2024    🕛 12--1:30pm

This panel discussion highlights the ethical issues of privacy, consent, and ownership of digitized cultural heritage materials held in library and museum collections around the globe. Megan Massanelli, Carolyn Friedrich, and David Grinnell will speak to the process of digitizing local LGBTQIA+ community publications where concerns are centered on informed consent, assumptions about anonymity in the original print medium, the right to be forgotten online, and community voices in those decisions about what is shared online. Jesse Obert will speak to his work with Greek material culture held outside of Greece in European and American museums, considering the absence of the Greek voice during the ongoing digitization of those materials as well as the ways in which European colonialism continues to exclude Greeks from their own cultural heritage, especially in the digital space.

How might researchers, educators, and scholars approach issues related to the access and use of digital surrogates? How might we advocate for community voices in the digitization, storage, and publication of cultural heritage materials? Join us for this conversation to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in ethical approaches to cultural heritage data.

**Speakers:**

-   **Megan Massanelli**, Archives & Special Collections Engagement and Outreach Librarian (University Library System)
-   **Carolyn Friedrich**, Digital Collections Coordinator (University Library System)
-   **David Grinnell**, Coordinator of Archives and Manuscripts (University Library System)
-   **Jesse Obert**, Digital World History Postdoctoral Associate (World History Center)

### Truth versus Authenticity

**Exploring the Ethical Paradoxes inherent in the Digital Representation of Text Data.**

📅 Friday, March 22, 2024    🕛 12--1:30pm

This interactive conversation will explore ethical questions related to the digital representation of texts. Mark DiMauro and Joshua Calandrella will discuss questions of translating and digitally representing sacred texts, considering both the mystic implications of technology and the ethical concerns that arise when artificial intelligence (AI) and other generative technology manipulates language and expresses linguistic patterns as mathematical datasets. What new and meaningful arrangements (datasets, translations, etc.) might become possible if these are generated with a reverence for the power traditionally associated with sacred and esoteric reading practices? Raja Adal will speak to these ethical questions as they relate to text encoding practices and consider how we might incorporate an ethical lens when working with other types of historical text data.

What kinds of textual materials do you work with in your disciplinary practices? How might researchers address the challenges of translating and digitally representing texts and grapple with concerns of distorting meaning? How might we anticipate and prevent accidental harm that could result from sharing text data openly online in an era of rapidly evolving AI algorithms?

Join us for this conversation to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in ethical approaches to textual data.

**Speakers:**

-   **Mark DiMauro**, Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities (UPJ)
-   **Joshua Calandrella**, Adjunct Professor of Composition (UPJ)
-   **Raja Adal**, Associate Professor of History

### Call for Participation

***The Call for Participation is now closed.***

What ethical concerns have you dealt with around data collection or creation in your field? Are you interested in sharing your experience confronting ethical challenges in working with different kinds of data? Have you been seeking opportunities to connect with other researchers facing similar data-sharing issues, or are you looking for collaborators to tackle interdisciplinary data analysis problems?

This CFP outlines an opportunity for all Pitt community members---including staff, students, researchers, and instructors---to contribute to a cross-disciplinary conversation around research ethics pertaining to data collection, creation, analysis, organization, storage, sharing, and other aspects of data-driven scholarship.

As machine learning technology continues to develop, as data sharing policies and funder mandates evolve, and as the lives and work of researchers and students are increasingly implicated in the growing datafication of our society, conversations around the ethical creation and use of data---defined broadly---are vital to the success of the university's mission. To promote increased dialogue across disciplines regarding the ethical issues we face in collecting, analyzing, and sharing data, the Digital Scholarship Services team within the University Library System will facilitate a series of interdisciplinary talks, moderated panel discussions, and unconference-style events around the theme of data ethics during the Spring 2024 semester. This series aims to enable Pitt community members to collaboratively explore ethical issues impacting data-driven scholarship across various departments and fields.
