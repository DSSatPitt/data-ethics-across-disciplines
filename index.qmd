**Data Ethics Across the Disciplines** is a discussion series hosted by the University of Pittsburgh Library System during Spring 2024.

## Interdisciplinary Data Ethics Unconference

üìÖ Friday, February 2, 2024¬†¬†¬†¬†üïõ 12--2pm

The University Library System's [Data Ethics Across the Disciplines discussion series](https://dssatpitt.github.io/data-ethics-across-disciplines/) kicks off with a mini-unconference! Join us for an engaging conversation on the ethical data creation, use, and sharing challenges faced by researchers and students at Pitt. Meet up with fellow scholars interested in data ethics and with panelists from the Data Ethics Across the Disciplines series, as we collaboratively determine a discussion agenda and split up into small and large group discussions on various topics, such as:

-   ethical data collection practices
-   evaluating data storage and sharing platforms through an ethics lens
-   tensions between data privacy and sharing
-   data harm
-   teaching data ethics in the classroom
-   ethics of reproducibility

A light lunch will be provided for participants. **Seats are limited for this unconference; please register only with a strong intention to attend.** We ask registrants to confirm their availability to attend 48 hours prior to this event and cancel your registration if you are no longer able to attend, to allow someone else to take your seat.

## Call for Participation

***The Call for Participation is now closed.***

What ethical concerns have you dealt with around data collection or creation in your field? Are you interested in sharing your experience confronting ethical challenges in working with different kinds of data? Have you been seeking opportunities to connect with other researchers facing similar data-sharing issues, or are you looking for collaborators to tackle interdisciplinary data analysis problems?

This CFP outlines an opportunity for all Pitt community members---including staff, students, researchers, and instructors---to contribute to a cross-disciplinary conversation around research ethics pertaining to data collection, creation, analysis, organization, storage, sharing, and other aspects of data-driven scholarship.

As machine learning technology continues to develop, as data sharing policies and funder mandates evolve, and as the lives and work of researchers and students are increasingly implicated in the growing datafication of our society, conversations around the ethical creation and use of data---defined broadly---are vital to the success of the university's mission. To promote increased dialogue across disciplines regarding the ethical issues we face in collecting, analyzing, and sharing data, the Digital Scholarship Services team within the University Library System will facilitate a series of interdisciplinary talks, moderated panel discussions, and unconference-style events around the theme of data ethics during the Spring 2024 semester. This series aims to enable Pitt community members to collaboratively explore ethical issues impacting data-driven scholarship across various departments and fields.
