Speaking from varied roles on such projects or programs, presenters will address what it means to take a global cultural approach to data ethics, given the nature of working with data produced by different communities and navigating the complex landscape of international policies and cultural expectations.\nA facilitated discussion will follow speaker introductions, aimed at sharing best practices and generating strategies for building global cultural competencies, identifying resources available to support global digital research at Pitt, and creating connections across disciplinary boundaries.\nWhat might it look like for researchers to take an ethical perspective on global data harm when developing international collaborations? What is involved when translating policies to practice and coordinating complex research projects? How might we address implicit power relations, funding inequities, and the continued impact of colonialism on the data produced by our research and other activities? Join us for this conversation to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in global approaches to data ethics.\nSpeakers:\n\nRuth Mostern, Professor of History and Director of the World History Center\nStephen Wludarski, Program Manager for the National Consortium for Teaching about Asia (NCTA) Pittsburgh, Asian Studies Program\nVictoria Sterling, Former Grant Manager for the Geography of Philosophy Project\n\n✏ Register\n\n\nSocial Media Data Ethics\nGrounding our Values and Localizing Best Better Practices.\n📅 Monday, February 26, 2024    🕛 12–1:30pm\nThis event aims to bring together members of the Pitt community for an interactive conversation regarding ethics and social media data. Two presenters - Lara Putnam and Elise Silva - will summarize the range of best practice guides that have already been developed on this topic and share a curated, annotated set of these external resources as a starting point with the hope of opening conversation. They hope specifically to localize this discussion around what tools, resources, and/or potential curricular vehicles Pitt teachers, mentors, and scholars feel they need in this rapidly changing arena. Our third presenter - Frances Corry - will then explore how values/ethics are expressed and mobilized by social media platform employees as they handle user data in the platform sunsetting process, providing another framework for thinking through the kinds of data that are generated and stored in social media platforms.\nHow are social media data used or generated in your disciplinary practices? What ethical concerns might we face across disciplinary boundaries when working with social media data? Join us for this conversation to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in ethical approaches to social media data.\nSpeakers:\n\nLara Putnam, UCIS Professor (History), Director of the Global Studies Center, and Co-lead for the Civic Resilience Initiative of the Pitt Disinformation Lab\nElise Silva, Postdoctoral Associate with Pitt Cyber’s Disinformation Lab and the Western PA Writing Project\nFrances Corry, Assistant Professor of Information Culture and Data Stewardship\n\n✏ Register\n\n\nPedagogy, Data Governance, and Predictive Analytics\nA conversation on institutional data practices at Pitt.\n📅 Friday, March 1, 2024    🕛 12–1:30pm\nThis panel assembles perspectives from multiple units across Pitt to explore predictive analytics, institutional data practices, data governance, and their pedagogical and ethical implications within a rapidly evolving technology landscape.\nAmanda Brodish will discuss the use of predictive analytics as part of the Pathways Student Success and Advising platform, providing an overview of the process used to engage faculty, students, and administrators in the use of predictive analytics; the development of a process allowing students to opt out; and the specific data points that are (and are not) included in the predictive analytics models. Michael Madison will speak to ongoing work at Pitt around data governance models and policies for institutional data. Gordon Mitchell will explore the question, how can an understanding of predictive analytics enhance data literacy for Pitt students preparing to work in our networked society?\nJoin us for an engaging discussion to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in data ethics.\nSpeakers:\n\nAmanda Brodish, Associate Vice Provost for Data Analytics\nMichael Madison, Professor of Law and John E.

Mark DiMauro and Joshua Calandrella will discuss questions of translating and digitally representing sacred texts, considering both the mystic implications of technology and the ethical concerns that arise when artificial intelligence (AI) and other generative technology manipulates language and expresses linguistic patterns as mathematical datasets. What new and meaningful arrangements (datasets, translations, etc.) might become possible if these are generated with a reverence for the power traditionally associated with sacred and esoteric reading practices? Raja Adal will speak to these ethical questions as they relate to text encoding practices and consider how we might incorporate an ethical lens when working with other types of historical text data.\nWhat kinds of textual materials do you work with in your disciplinary practices? How might researchers address the challenges of translating and digitally representing texts and grapple with concerns of distorting meaning? How might we anticipate and prevent accidental harm that could result from sharing text data openly online in an era of rapidly evolving AI algorithms?\nJoin us for this conversation to learn more and connect with other Pitt community members interested in ethical approaches to textual data.\nSpeakers:\n\nMark DiMauro, Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities (UPJ)\nJoshua Calandrella, Adjunct Professor of Composition (UPJ)\nRaja Adal, Associate Professor of History\n\n✏ Register\n\n\nEthical Tensions between Privacy and Access for Human-Subjects Data\n📅 Monday, March 25, 2024    🕛 12–1:30pm\nEvent details forthcoming!\nJoin us for this panel discussion to connect with other Pitt community members interested in ethical approaches to human-subjects data across disciplines.\nSpeakers:\n\nRavi Patel, Lead Innovation Advisor in the School of Pharmacy\nAmin Rahimian, Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering\nHanning Wang, PhD Student in Sociology\n\n✏ Register\n\nTo find out about more digital scholarship events, subscribe to the Library Digital Scholarship Services newsletter!"

When we order a mug from Amazon, or like a picture of puppies on Facebook, we enjoy the ease and entertainment of these services, but the inner workings that make these transactions so seamless and satisfying are hidden from us. We are promised and have come to expect technology to ensure our package arrives in two days or that our latest post is seen by our followers, but we are rarely compelled to question the “how” of these operations. What might we uncover if we dared to look into the mechanisms that make our lives so convenient and efficient? During this session, attendees will collectively explore questions about costs, labor and automation, and critically consider the true price of the technological infrastructure that supports our ways of living.\n\n✏ More info and register\n\n\nBuilding Partnerships to Advance Ethical Research: Collaborators, Communities & Companies\n📅 Wednesday, February 28, 2024    🕙 10am–4pm\n\nAs research teams become larger and more complex, forging effective partnerships to ensure the ethical conduct of research has become more challenging. Yet creating successful collaborations to ensure the responsible conduct of research is crucial at all stages of the research process. Researchers need to build a team that successfully integrates investigators, research staff, and trainees in the responsible conduct of research. They need to be able to partner respectfully in community-engaged and community-led research, building alliances to advance equity, inclusion, and cross-learning. And in creating relationships with funders and companies to develop and apply the research, researchers need to fulfill ethical duties including disclosure and managing conflicts of interest and commitment.\nThis conference will discuss ways to build strong partnerships with investigators, communities, clinical research professionals, and companies to promote the ethical conduct and translation of research. Speakers will consider the elements of successful collaboration that promote research integrity, inclusivity, mutual respect, and accountability in the conduct of research.\n\n✏ More info and register\n\n\nShepherding Neurotechnology through Regulatory Review\n📅 Wednesday, February 28, 2024    🕞 3:30–5:30pm\n\nThis talk is hosted by the Pitt-CMU Rehab Neuroengineering Laboratory and co-sponsored by the Research, Ethics and Society Initiative of Pitt Research.\n\n✏ More info and register\n\n\nInequality & the Environment: Moving from Science to Action that Advances Environmental Justice and Health Equity\n📅 Friday, March 1, 2024    🕐 1–2pm\n\nLara Cushing, PhD, MPH\nJonathan and Karin Fielding Presidential Chair in Health Equity and\nAssistant Professor of Environmental Health Sciences\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nAbstract: People of color are more likely to breathe dirty air, drink contaminated water, and live near hazardous waste sites, industrial agriculture operations, and other sources of pollution. Accelerating climate change is having additional disproportionate effects on minoritized populations. This talk will discuss structural determinants of environmental health disparities and community-engaged research to develop decision support tools that advance environmental justice.\n\n✏ More info and register\n\n\nRead & Discuss: The Dangerous Art of Text Mining\n📅 Monday, March 18, 2024    🕝 2:30–4pm\n\nJoin the World History Center for a discussion about The Dangerous Art of Text Mining: A Methodology for Digital History by Jo Guldi. A limited number of copies of the book will be made available before the event. The book is available to read online here.\nThe Dangerous Art of Text Mining celebrates the bold new research now possible because of text mining: the art of counting words over time. However, this book also presents a warning: without help from the humanities, data science can distort the past and lead to perilous errors. The book opens with a rogue’s gallery of errors, then tours the ground-breaking analyses that have resulted from collaborations between humanists and data scientists. Jo Guldi explores how text mining can give a glimpse of the changing history of the past—for example, how quickly Americans forgot the history of slavery. Textual data can even prove who was responsible in Congress for silencing environmentalism over recent decades. The book ends with an impassioned vision of what text mining in defence of democracy would look like, and why humanists need to be involved.\n\n✏ More info and register\n\n\nThe Black Prisoners of Stateville: Race, Research, and Reckoning at the Origin of Precision Medicine\n📅 Friday, March 22, 2024    🕛 12–1pm\n\nJames Tabery, PhD, MA\nProfessor of Philosophy\nCenter for Health Ethics, Arts & Humanities\nUniversity of Utah\nAbstract: The modern science of pharmacogenomics, which set the stage for precision medicine, was born in a prison outside Chicago 70 years ago. Clinical researchers with the US Army and the University of Chicago used Black prisoners at the Stateville Penitentiary, as well as their family members and other Black community members in the vicinity, to determine why some people have a dangerous reaction to antimalarial drugs. The research, in hindsight, is shocking. There is a large body of research ethics scholarship that reflects on the controversial research conducted at Stateville; oddly, however, the standard version of this story is that the research involved only white prisoners. In this talk, Dr. Tabery will share what he and his colleagues have uncovered about the research involving the Black participants, ask why their contribution to the famous history of precision medicine has been omitted, and consider appropriate ways to remember a community of people whose bodies and blood were used to give rise to precision medicine.\n\n✏ More info and register\n\n\nCollective Futures\n📅 Wednesday, March 27, 2024    🕙 10am–12pm\n\nAs humans, we are inherently future-oriented. Our dreams and hopes fuel our lives and livelihoods. When you think of the words “future” and “progress”, what comes to mind? Our popular media and rhetoric is filled with narratives that essentially equate progress and the future with the emergence of superior technology that will either solve all human problems or destroy humanity entirely. Who drives these dominant visions of the future that we are steering toward? How might we conceptualize future possibilities, outside of a framework of technological inevitability and centrality? For example, what might future families, communities, gardens, and schools look and feel like? During this session, we will collectively explore our questions about progress, and imagine education futures rooted in justice and freedom.\n\n✏ More info and register\n\n\nEthics of Using AI in Medicine\n📅 Friday, April 5, 2024    🕛 12–1pm\n\nKellie N.
