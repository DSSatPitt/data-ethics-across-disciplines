Are you interested in sharing your experience confronting ethical challenges in working with different kinds of data? Have you been seeking opportunities to connect with other researchers facing similar data-sharing issues, or are you looking for collaborators to tackle interdisciplinary data analysis problems?\n\nThis CFP outlines an opportunity for all Pitt community members---including staff, students, researchers, and instructors---to contribute to a cross-disciplinary conversation around research ethics pertaining to data collection, creation, analysis, organization, storage, sharing, and other aspects of data-driven scholarship.\n\nAs machine learning technology continues to develop, as data sharing policies and funder mandates evolve, and as the lives and work of researchers and students are increasingly implicated in the growing datafication of our society, conversations around the ethical creation and use of data---defined broadly---are vital to the success of the university's mission. To promote increased dialogue across disciplines regarding the ethical issues we face in collecting, analyzing, and sharing data, the Digital Scholarship Services team within the University Library System will facilitate a series of interdisciplinary talks, moderated panel discussions, and unconference-style events1 around the theme of data ethics during the Spring 2024 semester. This series aims to enable Pitt community members to collaboratively explore ethical issues impacting data-driven scholarship across various departments and fields.\n\n[Read the full CFP](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ras545_pitt_edu/ETwAdtwmo5lLos9wMleE49cBg1fSNNgXhvmu2fHLaOUc_A).\n\n## Upcoming Events\n\n**Kickoff Unconference**\\\nðŸ“… January 2024 (date TBD)\n\n*Check back for event info as we post it, or [subscribe to the Library Digital Scholarship Services newsletter!](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/DF8BAC3FE84F3E2D)*\n\n**Wrap-up Unconference**\\\nðŸ“… April 2024 (date TBD)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n**Data Ethics Across the Disciplines** is a discussion series hosted by the University of Pittsburgh Library System during Spring 2024.\n\n## Call for Participation\n\n***The Call for Participation is now closed.***\n\nWhat ethical concerns have you dealt with around data collection or creation in your field?
